Breast Cancer Classification Project
Objective
This project aims to apply supervised learning techniques to the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The goal is to evaluate various classification algorithms and determine their effectiveness in predicting the presence of breast cancer.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the breast cancer dataset provided by sklearn, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The dataset includes 30 features and a binary target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of cancer.

Key Components
Loading and Preprocessing:

Loaded the breast cancer dataset and converted it into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handled missing values (if any) and performed feature scaling using StandardScaler to standardize the feature values.
Classification Algorithms Implemented:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Each algorithm was trained on the training set, and performance was evaluated based on accuracy.

Model Comparison:

Compared the performance of all five classifiers based on accuracy metrics.
Identified the best and worst performing models.
Results
The performance of each model was analyzed, revealing the best and worst performing algorithms, which can be useful for making informed decisions in medical diagnostics.

Tools and Technologies
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various supervised learning techniques for a critical real-world problem, providing insights into their performance in the context of breast cancer classification.
